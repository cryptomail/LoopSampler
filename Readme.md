# HI
### I'm Josh and this is a loop sampler demo.

Running:
1. Download source
2. Build
3. Run in sim/phone
4. Choose a loop duration (it's disruptive so do it up front)
5. Hit the record button and slam on the air horn button at a cadence that suits your fancy
7. Hit play button and listen to Simon as it repeats back what you said.

This app is not evolved (purposefully).  I made it to suffice an interface need I had for an app I'm building.  That being said if you find it useful or annoying, or enthralling, then feel free to reach out to me.  Patches welcome.  Muah!
